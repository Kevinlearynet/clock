# Progressive Clock App

This simple clock app provides a local weather forecast for the next night or day, and is a great example of a progressive web app. It will appear as a native app in iOS when loaded at https://www.kevinleary.net/clock/, and can be saved as a shortcut with a custom icon.

The project build is handled by Codekit, because that's what I originally used a few years ago when this was made. If there's demand for a better build I'll put together a Gulp build process for re-use, just drop an issue with a request.
